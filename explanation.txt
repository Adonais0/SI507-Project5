    I am accessing the Tumblr API and gathering:
    - 100 posts for each of 3 blogs I'm going to search for
    - For each post, I'll be accessing the title of the post, the summary of the post, the tags of the post, post date, and the short URL of the post
    - I'll write 3 CSV files, one for each blogâ€™s posts 
    - Data in each CSV file: 5 columns -- title, summary, tags, date of post, and url of the post
    - URL for the API: https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/{blog-identifier}/posts
    - If necessary, URL describing the authentication process for the API: https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#auth
